what are react Hooks?
    - Hooks in react are built-in-functions that allows developers to use lifecycle methods and state functions
    inside functional components
    - they are backward compatible an can work with existing code thus can be adopteed easily into projects.

the Don'ts of Hooks 
    - Don't call hooks inside loops, nested functions, or conditions
    - use hooks at the top level of your functions
    - make sure that hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders, allowing react to preseve 
    the state of hooks
    - Dont call hooks from regular javascript functions, instead call inside react functions or custom hooks
